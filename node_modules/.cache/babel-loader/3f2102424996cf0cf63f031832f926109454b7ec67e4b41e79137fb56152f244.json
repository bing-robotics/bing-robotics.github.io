Traditional parameter estimation methods face limitations such as reliance on initial   guesses,   labor-intensive  fitting  procedures, and complex testing setups. On the other hand, purely data-driven machine learning methods struggle to capture inherent physical constraints and typically require large datasets for optimal performance. To address these challenges,   we introduce the Fine-Tuning Hybrid Dynamics   (FTHD)   method,   which   integrates   supervised   and unsupervised   Physics-Informed   Neural   Networks   (PINNs), combining  physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques. FTHD fine-tunes a pre-trained Deep Dynamics Model (DDM) using a smaller training dataset, delivering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the Deep Pacejka Model (DPM) and outperforming the original DDM. Furthermore, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is embedded within FTHD (EKF-FTHD) to effectively   manage   noisy   real-world   data,   ensuring   accurate denoising   while   preserving   the   vehicle's   essential   physical characteristics. The proposed FTHD framework is validated through scaled simulations using the BayesRace Physics-based Simulator and full-scale   real-world   experiments   from   the   Indy   Autonomous Challenge.   Results   demonstrate   that   the   hybrid   approach significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy, even with reduced   data,   and   outperforms   existing   models.   EKF-FTHD enhances robustness by denoising real-world data while maintaining physical insights, representing a notable advancement in vehicle dynamics modeling for high-speed autonomous racing.\",bio:\"Shiming Fang received the B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China in 2016, and the M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK in 2017.

UAV swarms solving problems in disaster response, infrastructure inspection, and agriculture rely on fresh and accurate maps to make navigation decisions. SLAM methods are capable of providing highly accurate maps through visual information, but are computationally heavy and ill-suited for unmanned aerial vehicles. For this reason, UAV swarms often dedicate one or more drones to frequent mapping, while other drones use map information for planning and trajectory generation. UAV swarms also centralize heavy-weight workloads like AI inference and SLAM map combination at the edge to extend UAV battery lives at the expense of network availability. Both map sharing and offloading necessitate high network bandwidth, but few SLAM or planning approaches account for this. We present NetSLAM, a network-assisted SLAM and planning system that builds environmental maps and UAV trajectories that meet quality of service requirements. NetSLAM embeds network information into SLAM maps so planning can compensate for changes in network connectivity across the environment. We also present NetPlan, a path planning algorithm which utilizes NetSLAM maps to build trajectories that maintain network connectivity requirements to maximize performance. Through real-world experiments and simulation, we show that NetSLAM maps network environments with limited additional overhead compared to existing SLAM approaches, while improving offloading performance significantly when multi-agent swarms consider network availability.\",bio:\"I am an incoming software developer and researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering currently completing my Masters in Computer Science (AI Track) from Binghamton University.

Several methods exist to enable locomotion and navigation capabilities for legged robots, however these methods generally do not leverage human domain knowledge or support direct interactions with people for collaborative decision making. In this talk, I will present a human-in-the-loop approach for both locomotion gait design and guided navigation. Each approach has been deployed on hardware, showcasing diverse locomotion gaits, and guided navigation for the visually impaired.\"\r\n                bio=\"\"\r\n                notes=\"Prof. Kaiyan Yu will offer a lab tour for all who are interested after the seminar talk.\"\r\n            />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div id=\"archive\" className=\"talks-wrapper\">\r\n            <h2>Archive</h2>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TalksSection;"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,MAAO,CAAAC,IAAI,KAAM,QAAQ,CAAC,OAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,yBAE1B,QAAS,CAAAC,YAAYA,CAAA,CAAG,CACtB,mBACED,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,eAAe,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC9BH,KAAA,QAAKI,EAAE,CAAC,gBAAgB,CAACF,SAAS,CAAC,eAAe,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC9CL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,kCAAgC,CAAI,CAAC,cACzCL,IAAA,MAAGO,KAAK,CAAE,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAM,CAAE,CAAAH,QAAA,cAACL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,MAAGS,IAAI,CAAC,2EAA2E,CAAAJ,QAAA,CAAC,gCAA8B,CAAG,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAG,CAAC,cAC1KL,IAAA,MAAGO,KAAK,CAAE,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAM,CAAE,CAAAH,QAAA,cAACL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,MAAGS,IAAI,CAAC,oEAAoE,CAAAJ,QAAA,CAAC,gCAA8B,CAAG,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAG,CAAC,cACnKL,IAAA,MAAGO,KAAK,CAAE,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAM,CAAE,CAAAH,QAAA,cAACL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,MAAGS,IAAI,CAAC,4FAA4F,CAAAJ,QAAA,CAAC,gCAA8B,CAAG,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAG,CAAC,cAC3LL,IAAA,MAAGO,KAAK,CAAE,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAM,CAAE,CAAAH,QAAA,cAACL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,MAAGS,IAAI,CAAC,4HAA4H,CAAAJ,QAAA,CAAC,4CAA0C,CAAG,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAG,CAAC,cACvOL,IAAA,MAAGO,KAAK,CAAE,CAACC,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAM,CAAE,CAAAH,QAAA,cAACL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,cAAIL,IAAA,MAAGS,IAAI,CAAC,iFAAiF,CAAAJ,QAAA,CAAC,+BAA6B,CAAG,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAI,CAAC,CAAG,CAAC,cAC/KL,IAAA,MAAGO,KAAK,CAAE,CAAEG,SAAS,CAAE,MAAM,CAAEF,QAAQ,CAAE,MAAO,CAAE,CAAAH,QAAA,CAAC,uBAAqB,CAAG,CAAC,EAC3E,CAAC,cACNH,KAAA,QAAKI,EAAE,CAAC,gBAAgB,CAACF,SAAS,CAAC,eAAe,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC9CL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,0BAAwB,CAAI,CAAC,cACjCL,IAAA,CAACF,IAAI,EACDQ,EAAE,CAAC,gFAAgF,CACnFK,IAAI,CAAC,+CAA+C,CACpDC,OAAO,CAAC,YAAY,CACpBC,KAAK,CAAC,gFAAgF,CACtFC,QAAQ,CAAC,4uBAA4uB,CACrvBC,GAAG,CAAC,2hBAA2hB,CAC/hBC,MAAM,CAAC,aAAa,CACvB,CAAC,EACD,CAAC,cACNd,KAAA,QAAKI,EAAE,CAAC,YAAY,CAACF,SAAS,CAAC,eAAe,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC1CL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,iBAAe,CAAI,CAAC,cACxBL,IAAA,CAACF,IAAI,EACDQ,EAAE,CAAC,2HAA2H,CAC9HK,IAAI,CAAC,+CAA+C,CACpDC,OAAO,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAClCC,KAAK,CAAC,2HAA2H,CACjIC,QAAQ,CAAC,6oBAA6oB,CACtpBG,SAAS,CAAE,ozBAAozB,CAC/zBC,MAAM,cAAElB,IAAA,MAAGS,IAAI,CAAC,2NAA2N,CAACU,MAAM,CAAC,QAAQ,CAACC,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAqB,CAAAf,QAAA,CAAC,gEAA8D,CAAG,CAAE,CACzVU,GAAG,CAAC,kYAAkY,CACzY,CAAC,cACFf,IAAA,CAACF,IAAI,EACDQ,EAAE,CAAC,2FAA2F,CAC9FK,IAAI,CAAC,+CAA+C,CACpDC,OAAO,CAAC,cAAc,CACtBC,KAAK,CAAC,2FAA2F,CACjGC,QAAQ,CAAC,iyDAAiyD,CAC1yDC,GAAG,CAAC,ocAAoc,CAC3c,CAAC,cACFf,IAAA,CAACF,IAAI,EACDQ,EAAE,CAAC,mEAAmE,CACtEK,IAAI,CAAC,iEAAiE,CACtEC,OAAO,CAAC,YAAY,CACpBC,KAAK,CAAC,mEAAmE,CACzEC,QAAQ,CAAC,2lDAA2lD,CACpmDC,GAAG,CAAC,kaAAka,CACtaC,MAAM,CAAC,uCAAuC,CACjD,CAAC,cACFhB,IAAA,CAACF,IAAI,EACDQ,EAAE,CAAC,0EAA0E,CAC7EK,IAAI,CAAC,uFAAuF,CAC5FC,OAAO,CAAC,eAAe,CACvBC,KAAK,CAAC,0EAA0E,CAChFC,QAAQ,CAAC,goBAAgoB,CACzoBC,GAAG,CAAC,EAAE,CACNM,KAAK,CAAC,0FAA0F,CACnG,CAAC,EACD,CAAC,cACNrB,IAAA,QAAKM,EAAE,CAAC,SAAS,CAACF,SAAS,CAAC,eAAe,CAAAC,QAAA,cACvCL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,SAAO,CAAI,CAAC,CACf,CAAC,EACD,CAAC,CAEd,CAEA,cAAe,CAAAF,YAAY","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}

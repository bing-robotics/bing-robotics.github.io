Traditional parameter estimation methods face limitations such as reliance on initial   guesses,   labor-intensive  fitting  procedures, and complex testing setups. On the other hand, purely data-driven machine learning methods struggle to capture inherent physical constraints and typically require large datasets for optimal performance. To address these challenges,   we introduce the Fine-Tuning Hybrid Dynamics   (FTHD)   method,   which   integrates   supervised   and unsupervised   Physics-Informed   Neural   Networks   (PINNs), combining  physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques. FTHD fine-tunes a pre-trained Deep Dynamics Model (DDM) using a smaller training dataset, delivering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the Deep Pacejka Model (DPM) and outperforming the original DDM. Furthermore, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is embedded within FTHD (EKF-FTHD) to effectively   manage   noisy   real-world   data,   ensuring   accurate denoising   while   preserving   the   vehicle's   essential   physical characteristics. The proposed FTHD framework is validated through scaled simulations using the BayesRace Physics-based Simulator and full-scale   real-world   experiments   from   the   Indy   Autonomous Challenge.   Results   demonstrate   that   the   hybrid   approach significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy, even with reduced   data,   and   outperforms   existing   models.
